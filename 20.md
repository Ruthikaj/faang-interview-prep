Here‚Äôs a simple and structured breakdown of all the topics you mentioned‚Äîgreat for quick understanding, interview prep, or notes. Let's break them into **concept**, **use**, and **key points**:

---

### 1. ‚öôÔ∏è **Socket Programming**
- **What it is:** A way to enable communication between devices (like client and server) over a network.
- **Use:** Used to build chat apps, games, web servers, etc.
- **Key Points:**
  - Uses IP (for addressing) and Port (for specific service).
  - Can be **TCP socket** (reliable) or **UDP socket** (faster).

---

### 2. üì° **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
- **What it is:** A **connection-oriented** protocol.
- **Use:** Used when reliable data transfer is needed (e.g., web browsing, emails).
- **Key Points:**
  - Three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
  - Error checking, flow control, congestion control
  - Slower but reliable

---

### 3. ‚ö° **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
- **What it is:** A **connectionless** protocol.
- **Use:** Used in real-time apps like **video streaming, online games**.
- **Key Points:**
  - No handshake or guarantee of delivery
  - Fast, lightweight
  - Packets may arrive out of order

### 4. üß± **OSI Model (7 Layers)**
| Layer No. | Name | Function |
|-----------|------|----------|
| 7 | Application | Interface for the end user |
| 6 | Presentation | Data translation, encryption |
| 5 | Session | Maintains sessions |
| 4 | Transport | TCP/UDP, segmentation |
| 3 | Network | IP addressing, routing |
| 2 | Data Link | MAC addressing |
| 1 | Physical | Hardware transmission |

- **Use:** Helps standardize network communication.
- **Tip:** Remember with: `All People Seem To Need Data Processing`.

### 5. üåê **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
- **What it is:** Assigns IP addresses automatically.
- **Use:** When you connect to Wi-Fi, it gives you an IP.
- **Key Points:**
  - Offers IP, Subnet Mask, Gateway, DNS
  - Works with DORA process: **Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge**

---

### 6. üîÅ **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**
- **What it is:** Maps an IP address to a MAC address.
- **Use:** When a device knows the IP but needs the MAC to send data.
- **Key Points:**
  - Works in local networks
  - Stored in ARP cache
  - Example: IP ‚Üí Who has it? MAC ‚Üí I have it.

---

### 7. üåç **IPv4**
- **What it is:** Internet Protocol version 4 (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
- **Use:** Used widely in current networks.
- **Key Points:**
  - 32-bit address ‚Üí 4 billion unique addresses
  - Exhausting due to many devices
  - Format: `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`

---

### 8. üåê **IPv6**
- **What it is:** Newer IP version to replace IPv4 (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`)
- **Use:** Supports trillions of addresses.
- **Key Points:**
  - 128-bit addressing
  - Built-in security (IPSec)
  - No need for NAT

| Socket     | Network communication          | Apps like chat, web servers          |
| TCP        | Reliable, ordered connection   | Web, email, file transfers           |
| UDP        | Fast, no guarantee             | Gaming, video/audio streaming        |
| OSI Model  | 7-layer model                  | Networking standard                  |
| DHCP       | Auto IP assigning              | Wi-Fi, networks                      |
| ARP        | IP to MAC resolution           | LAN communication                    |
| IPv4       | 32-bit address system          | Traditional networks                 |
| IPv6       | 128-bit address system         | Future-proof internet addressing     |
